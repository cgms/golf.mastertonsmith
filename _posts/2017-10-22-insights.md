## What should I work on?
Now I've decided to be structured about how I improve at golf, what do I work on? I've got a coach I am seeing once a month roughly and we are focusing on getting me inside on the way down and not flipping through release, slow progress but it is coming along.

I've used Game Golf for a while as I mentioned, but lets see if we can look at the data to see where to focus. You can select a taregt handicap range and the rounds you want to analyse, and get a view of where you are loising strokes. I'm keen to get to low teens handicap as a starter, sollets measure myself against a 10 handicapper, and use the last 5 rounds as they are the most representative of my current game:

I'm pretty happy with the approach stat, shows what I usually think which is my mid to short iron game is my strength. I'm surprised my short game isn't hurting me more, but maybe my approach is helping there.

Putting and off the tee are the obvious focus. Putting is something nice and easy to work on over the off season, so I will be focusing on that and talking more about it in the coming weeks.

Off the tee is where my game really pivots I think, so lets focus there, and over the next few rounds I want to answer the following over the next few days:
* Should I be using my driver?
* What is my safe shot?
* Where do I find my confidence.

But the first thing to answer is can I drive the ball?
