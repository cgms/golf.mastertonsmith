## Gedney Hill

Played a round with my father in law, Ken, and his mate Chris. Gedney Hill is a curious little course that has a fairly large number of 220yd par 4s, but they are dog legs so you have to lay up or risk the chance of losing the ball if you go for the green and aren't completely accurate.

On top of this Storm Brian was battering the country, sow e were hitting into 20mph winds most of the day. 

All in all a fun round, pars and a birdie is never a bad round, however bad tee shots brought the blobs again.
