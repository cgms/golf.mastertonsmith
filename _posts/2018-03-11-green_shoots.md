## Warming up for spring

Spring seems to be approaching and I managed to get 2 rounds of golf in this weekend. 30 points in the div 2 on Saturday with 9 temps and spiked greens was not a bad return. Could have been so much better though as I had 5 blobs. All of those were from dodgy driving again. 2 4 pointers including a birdie and par on the 17th were very positive.

Iron swings were very nice, good rhtyhm and as long as I stay in my heels then the swing was good. Off to chrus to sort the driving

Same again today, with driver nothing good, except the 18th, without I was using my 3 iron, hitting it 215 easily and being consistent. I now know how to score if I want to, so time to add the driver to really bring everything together.
