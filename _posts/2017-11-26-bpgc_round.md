## Friendly with Ken

Had a fun round with Ken. As per usual I duck hooked the tee shot off the first and the second was stright down the right hand side.
Only hit two proper drives, 8th adn 16th. Both were short backswings with better transitions.

Really happy with the chipping around the green. Using the PW it's going well, so that is encouraging. Also very good weight with the putter, sank a few 5 ft plus putts.
