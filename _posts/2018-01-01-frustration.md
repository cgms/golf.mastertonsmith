## Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

New Year, same problems. First round today and again didn't hit more than 3 consistent drives. I'm just not giving myself the chance to score well by getting onto the fairway, or at least more than 80 in front of the tee.

I'm fairly certain my sway / slide is where the real problem lies, off for a lesson in a couple of weeks to work on it. Going to approach this year with fun and relexation as the key, with a large chunk of improvement!
