## The Tools
### Game Golf
I've had a Game Golf for a while now but haven't been very good at using the data. Starting from now I'll be looking into the data and use it to focus my practice.

### Practice Sheets
Range practice is all good and well but without the right focus I'm not working out if it is making me better. I'll start recording the outcome of the shots I hit, amking my practice more targeted.
