## It's close...

I had a lesson a couple of weeks ago, focusing on flattening the wrist on my drive. Unfortunately I've not had time to practice before today's round and it showed. I'm not relaxed enough in the feeling to not be thinking about it during the swing.

I hit 5 really bad drives, 3 pulled or pushed and 3 straight and true. The iron play is now plenty good enough that with even a mediocre drive on or around the short stuff I am in with a par or bogey chance no problems.

Off to see Chris on Tuesday lunchtime, and nothing but a decent drive is allowed to be the outcome.
